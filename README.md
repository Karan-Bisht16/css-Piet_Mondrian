A simple website made only using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, focusing on [**Piet Mondrian**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian). 
This project implements his neoplastic artworks using the CSS grid layout to showcase and pay homage to his distinctive style. 

The website serves as both a tribute and a practical exercise in web design and layout techniques.

The inspiration for this project came from my [**The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp**](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) course created by [Dr. Angela Yu](https://x.com/yu_angela).
